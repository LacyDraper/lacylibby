# Introduction

This app was created as a Capstone project for [Ada Developers Academy.](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/) 

## Description
Little Free Libraries are tiny structures that individuals put in front of their homes and apartments so that community members can give and take books. [The nonprofit organization](https://littlefreelibrary.org/) supporting this project has created a [static map](https://littlefreelibrary.org/ourmap/), that shows all the locations of the libraries. There is no way to tell which books are in each library until you go up to them and explore their contents. This makes the libraries less accessible to disabled folks, and people who do not have the leasure time to stroll through the neighborhood looking for specific books or genres. Our project is a simple, interactive way that neighbors can help create a rudimentary "inventory" system by posting a photo of the spines of the books in a particular library.
